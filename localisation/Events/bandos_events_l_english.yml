 bandos_flavor.1.t:0 "Strategies of the Goblins"
 bandos_flavor.1.d:0 "Goblins might look puny... because they are. Though after many many years of being pushed around, they've had to learn to make peace with their puniness and in large numbers, can overwhelm our enemies."
 bandos_flavor.1.a:0 "Glory to the God of War!"

 bandos_flavor.2.t:0 "Strategies of the Hobgoblins"
 bandos_flavor.2.d:0 "Hobgoblins are a bit beefier than goblins, and great at dealing with pesky flying things. Feed them enough limpwurt roots and they get pretty loyal, too."
 bandos_flavor.2.a:0 "Glory to the God of War!"

 bandos_flavor.3.t:0 "Strategies of the Ogres"
 bandos_flavor.3.d:0 "The Feldip Hills Ogres are a staple in any Bandosian army. For brains, brawl, size and speed they're pretty much right in the middle. They are worryingly developing their own culture. Doesn't the War God himself say thinkers must die?"
 bandos_flavor.3.a:0 "Glory to the God of War!"

 bandos_flavor.4.t:0 "Strategies of the Jogres"
 bandos_flavor.4.d:0 "These are ogres, but jungly! Jogres are very good at resisting mosquito bites and tropical diseases but they haven't yet got the hang of poison resistance. Still, if you want to fight in difficult terrain, they're great to have around."
 bandos_flavor.4.a:0 "Glory to the God of War!"

 bandos_flavor.5.t:0 "Strategies of the Mogres"
 bandos_flavor.5.d:0 "Who needs ships when you have ogres that can breathe underwater! Mogres are smarter than most of the stuff at the bottom of the sea, so long as you keep them away from Karambwans. This makes them pretty unrivalled down there."
 bandos_flavor.5.a:0 "Glory to the God of War!"

 bandos_flavor.6.t:0 "Strategies of the Trolls"
 bandos_flavor.6.d:0 "Trolls have been pretty unloyal to the War God. They forget he made them what they are, and have been drifting away from the faith altogether. But their strength is needed, and it's time to bring them back to our side."
 bandos_flavor.6.a:0 "Glory to the God of War!"

 bandos_flavor.7.t:0 "Strategies of the Giants"
 bandos_flavor.7.d:0 "We got a few giants on our side in the past. They're not very talkative and they're often not that strong for their size, yet they can be pretty gullible. Remember: Moss Giants are with Guthix. They are not our friends."
 bandos_flavor.7.a:0 "Glory to the God of War!"

 bandos_flavor.8.t:0 "Strategies of the Cloud Giants"
 bandos_flavor.8.d:0 "Hang on a second, where were THESE giants when we needed them?! They're bigger, stronger and even live in the sky?! Clearly we need to learn whatever it is they know."
 bandos_flavor.8.a:0 "Glory to the God of War!"
 
 bandos_flavor.9.t:0 "The Big High War God Chooses Us"
 bandos_flavor.9.d:0 "Hopespear was goblin who stopped Plain of Mud war. He say Big High War God tell him goblins eventually combine under Chosen Commander. We now so strong that there no doubt we have Chosen Commander."
 bandos_flavor.9.a:0 "Glory to the Big High War God!"
 
 bandos_flavor.10.t:0 "Strategies of the Ronin Ogres"
 bandos_flavor.10.d:0 "The reach of the Ogres is far - some live as far afield as the Shield in the Wushanko Isles. They have learnt from the ways of the Gu - and left them, stealing their knowledge for the glory of Bandos."
 bandos_flavor.10.a:0 "Glory to the God of War!"

 bandos_flavor.11.t:0 "Strategies of the Orks"
 bandos_flavor.11.d:0 "Orks are staple forces in Bandosian armies. They have good strength for their moderate size and tend not to let personal ambition get in the way of their combat abilities."
 bandos_flavor.11.a:0 "Glory to the God of War!"
