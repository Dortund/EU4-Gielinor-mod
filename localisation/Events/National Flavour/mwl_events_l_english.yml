 flavor_mwl.1.d:0 "Zarosian legends seem to corroborate the stories of such a god being Seren's brother, and yet the two differ greatly. Both the heretical view of Seren and the Dark Lord have a great attachment to the lives and deaths of people, yet Zaros seems... empty. Without passion."
 flavor_mwl.1.a:0 "We should make room for the celebration of Seren's family."
 flavor_mwl.1.b:0 "We will not entertain yet another heresy."
