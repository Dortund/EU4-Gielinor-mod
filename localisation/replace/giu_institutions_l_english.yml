 reconstruction:0 "Reconstruction"
 desc_reconstruction:0 "The scars of the Third Age has mostly, but not entirely, healed. Much of the Fourth Age was marred by new conflicts between mortals, but by the latter parts of the Age, a more settled arrangement with more expansive diplomacy became the norm. Some who had hid from the chaos of the Third and Fourth ages - including most dwarves and gnomes - reemerged. Trade routes slowly started expanding beyond states' immediate surroundings. Only a few places remain untouched by this development - Karamja, due to the sheer devastation the island faced in the Third Age, and realms of Bandosians, due to their God's emphasis on war."

 desc_architecture:0 "Great building works are not new to Gielinor - the pyramids of Kharid, the city of Prifddinas and so forth are testaments to this - yet construction projects of recent centuries have tended to be impernament or disorganised. However, as the dwarves of Keldagrim, the TzHaar and others increasingly meet with the dwellers of surface lands, their experiences in construction have combined with the practical challenges of the present world to inspire a new architectural tradition. Around Gielinor, new castles and palaces are being commissioned and new, more efficient towns are emerging out of the chaos of the past."

 desc_runecrafting:0 "Nearly all magic performed by mortals requires runestones, but by the late Fourth Age the remaining supply from the God Wars had all but evaporated. In some remote portions of the world, magic seemed little more than a myth. However, with the discovery of rune essence rocks to the far north of Gielinor, there is once again access to the raw material necessary for creating runes. The runecrafting altars dotted around the world and long-since abandoned are seeing use once more."

 statehood:0 "Statehood"
 desc_statehood:0 "Through runecrafting and growing numbers of mages, emerging human states were able to secure a decisive advantage over their foes and to unite their regions under one flag. The new nations of Asgarnia and Kandarin are key examples. Parallel to this is a movement towards more organised government in realms as diverse as Kourend and Morytania. Though this move towards organised statehood would provide many humans with greater stability than before, it often came at the cost of other races and those of minority religious groups. Conflict between Saradomists and Zamorakians continued - within nations rather than between them."

 exploration:0 "Exploration"
 desc_exploration:0 "It is difficult to travel in an environment of chaos, but the Fifth Age was a more stable time. More organised states created organised navies capable of protecting trade - and projecting power - around the world. Nations looked for new places to claim and new treasures to take, as well as for potential new alliances in distant, powerful, realms. Despite this shift, much of Gielinor would remain unknown to the typical inhabitants of the world. Only a few adventurers would travel significantly during this time."

 desc_quests:0 "As travel throughout Gielinor became easier, the number of adventurers grew. No longer a fringe interest but an entire major segment of the workforce, the presence of adventurers revolutionised the world of work. Strange problems that previously required years of training and research could be outsourced to wanderers driven by the desire for experiences more than the need for a constant material compensation. By neatly compartmentalising odd jobs into a category known as Quests, the nations of Gielinor were able to be run more efficiently than ever before."

 desc_invention:0 "Keldagrim and Dorgesh-Kaan alike pushed Gielinor's technology into incredible new places, though this would just be the start. With the advent of divine energy, actions that previously required machines the size of buildings and vast geothermal power plants now required a device small enough to fit on most pieces of armour. The possibilities of such augmentors are nearly limitless, resulting in a surge in inventors throughout Gielinor. It is rumoured that through the art of Invention may be the only means by which a mortal can take on a God..."
