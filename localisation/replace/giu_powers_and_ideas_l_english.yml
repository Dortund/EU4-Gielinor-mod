Our prior attempts to capture a live sample resulted in the Spinner exploding into highly corrosive goo. However, with the use of magic on a similar frequency to the portals they defend, we have finally kept one alive for research purposes. Their regenerative abilities are particularly impressive and can be drawn upon."
