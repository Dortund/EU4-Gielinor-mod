 flavor_pph.1.d:0 "With the terrifying threat of the Vampyres looming over Port Phasmatys, a necromancer from the Wushanko Isles offers us a solution. Excavating deep under the port, they have uncovered ectoplasm they plan to use to create an energy barrier capable of repelling the Vampyric hordes."

 PPH_ectofuntus_start_tooltip:0 "Faced with such a powerful barrier, Morytania is likely to call any war against us off - but necromancy always has its price..."
 flavor_pph.1.b:0 "I don't know, messing with necromatic energies sounds dangerous."
 
 flavor_pph.2.t:0 "The Cost of Necromancy"
 flavor_pph.2.d:0 "The Ectofuntus has had a strange effect on the people of Port Phasmatys - it caused the population to wither away and die, but leaving their souls bound to the world. Worse, the Necromancer who built the Ectofuntus has now used it to seize power!"
 flavor_pph.2.a:0 "Who could have seen this coming?"
