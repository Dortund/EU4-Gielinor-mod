 excessive_tithe.1.t:0 "Blood Supplies Run Dry"
 excessive_tithe.1.d:0 "Vampyres need blood to survive, and plentiful blood to thrive. The realm of [Root.GetName], however, is dangerously low on blood supplies, causing desperate vampyres to excessively drain tithes for any blood they can get. If the situation persists, our tithes will die off, and so shall we!"
 excessive_tithe.1.a:0 "Even nobles must make sacrifices in this time."
 excessive_tithe.1.b:0 "Feeding the tithes better would provide more blood."
 excessive_tithe.1.c:0 "Our tributaries need to work harder."
 excessive_tithe.1.e:0 "The answer to this problem is fresh conquest!"
 
 excessive_tithe.2.t:0 "Anti-Vampyre Uprising in [local_myreque_uprising.GetName]"
 excessive_tithe.2.d:0 "Sensing what they believe to be our weakness in [local_myreque_uprising.GetName], a local [local_myreque_uprising.Religion.GetName] group is assembling to resist our rule. How should we crush them?"
 excessive_tithe.2.a:0 "Let them fight. We will cut them down."
 excessive_tithe.2.b:0 "We don't have time for this! Give them a taste of true Vampyric power!"
 
 excessive_tithe.3.t:0 "Noble Caught with Secret Blood Supply!"
 excessive_tithe.3.d:0 "In a time of limited blood supplies, the prospect of one of our nobles hoarding supplies for themselves reflects badly on our leadership if we allow it to continue - but the nobles won't like us taking from them for any reason."
 excessive_tithe.3.a:0 "It must be seized!"
 excessive_tithe.3.b:0 "Let this slide."
 
 excessive_tithe.4.t:0 "The Werewolf Plot"
 excessive_tithe.4.d:0 "The River Salve is a barrier to Vampyres crossing into Misthalin and taking blood from its population. However, the Salve's barrier has weakened enough in recent years to allow werewolves to cross. Werewolves can take humans from Misthalin back to Morytania on our behalf to use as blood tithes - so long as we can pay them for their trouble or pressure them into compliance."
 excessive_tithe.4.a:0 "Pay the werewolves to take blood tithes for us."
 excessive_tithe.4.b:0 "Threaten the werewolves to give us the tithes!"
 excessive_tithe.4.c:0 "We can't trust these dogs to do a thing!"
 
 excessive_tithe.5.t:0 "Missing Civilians in [local_stolen_civilians.GetName]!"
 excessive_tithe.5.d:0 "A number of people have gone missing in [local_stolen_civilians.GetName] with no clear explanation."
 excessive_tithe.5.a:0 "This is clearly an internal criminal problem."
 excessive_tithe.5.b:0 "It must be the Wilderness!"
 excessive_tithe.5.c:0 "Perhaps the solution rests in Morytania."
 excessive_tithe.5.e:0 "Unfortunately, there is nothing we can do."
 
 excessive_tithe.6.t:0 "Blood Supplies from Wushanko"
 excessive_tithe.6.d:0 "Pirates from the Wushanko Isles offer to bring us fresh victims to restock our blood supplies, but we would need to pay them."
 excessive_tithe.6.a:0 "Fine, fine, pay them."
 excessive_tithe.6.b:0 "Buy corpses from overseas? We don't know where they've been!"
 
 excessive_tithe.7.t:0 "Ranis Drakan Slain!"
 excessive_tithe.7.d:0 "Lowerniel Drakan's heir, Ranis, has been killed! Whether by a rival noble or a human resistance is at this time difficult to tell, but it amounts to the greatest loss of the Drakan family in an age."
 excessive_tithe.7.a:0 "They underestimate the power of Lowerniel. Let the plotters overconfidently make their next move - he will then destroy them."
 excessive_tithe_bait_the_plot_tooltip:0 "This course of action could lead to another high-profile Vampyric death, but is an opportunity to crush the resistance to Lowerniel's rule at its heart."
 excessive_tithe.7.b:0 "The nobles have run rampant for too long! Ranis shall be avenged!"
 excessive_tithe_revenge_for_ranis:0 "Revenge for Ranis"
 excessive_tithe_blame_the_nobles_tooltip:0 "This course of action will keep Lowerniel safe from plotting nobles - but it will be difficult to organise any sort of effort to find more blood tithes."
 excessive_tithe.7.c:0 "Clearly the humans haven't been put in their place! Ranis shall be avenged!"
 excessive_tithe_blame_the_humans_tooltip:0 "Blaming the humans will make it difficult for any resistance groups, but will stretch the already depleted blood supplies even thinner."
 
 excessive_tithe.8.t:0 "At the Gates of [Root.Capital.GetName]"
 excessive_tithe.8.d:0 "It appears the plan to stake out Ranis' killers has resulted in a surprising outcome - [Root.Heir.GetName] working with a human resistance group known as the Myreque! But Lowerniel is prepared... What shall their fate be?"
 excessive_tithe.8.a:0 "Hunt them! Like the prey they are!"
 excessive_tithe_thrill_of_the_hunt:0 "Although the thrill of the hunt is invigorating, it also leaves Lowerniel vulnerable to a Myreque counter-attack."
 excessive_tithe.8.b:0 "Kill them and be done with it."
 
 excessive_tithe.9.t:0 "Myreque Counterattack Slays Lowerniel!"
 excessive_tithe.9.d:0 "The decision to let the Myreque flee Lowerniel for the thrill of the hunt was perhaps not his most sensible tactic. After a long, gruelling battle, he was killed by his own blade - the Sunspear. And an old plotter returns to take the throne..."
 excessive_tithe.9.a:0 "Why didn't he just kill them?"

 excessive_tithe.10.t:0 "The Return of Queen Efaritay"
 excessive_tithe.10.d:0 "With the death of Lowerniel Drakan, a surprising sight has been spotted in Morytania - an Icyene, or more precisely, Queen Efaritay, former ruler of Hallowvale! She is willing to work on a solution to Morytania's blood shortages in exchange for better treatment of the humans of Morytania."

 excessive_tithe.10.b:0 "She was rightfully conquered, she should stay conquered."
 
 excessive_tithe.11.t:0 "Blisterwood Found in Meiyerditch!"
 excessive_tithe.11.d:0 "It was thought impossible, but it appears that humans have infiltrated Darkmeyer and taken from the accurséd Blisterwood tree - perhaps a result of Lowerniel's recent purge of Vampyric nobles resulting in lax security. We must make a response lest the humans overrun us all!"
 excessive_tithe.11.a:0 "They want war? We shall bring them war!"
 reign_of_terror_tooltip:0 "The §YReign of Terror§! shall persist until the end of the end of the §YExcessive Tithe§! disaster."
 excessive_tithe.11.b:0 "They are humans; what's the worst they could do?"
 ignore_blisterwood_tooltip:0 "Ignoring a strong human resistance movement will probably get Lowerniel killed."
 
 excessive_tithe.12.t:0 "Coalition of Nobles and Myreque Slay Lowerniel Drakan!"
 excessive_tithe.12.d:0 "Lowerniel Drakan over the centuries had become increasingly insular, ignorng the many significant changed to Morytania, and arrogantly crushing his greatest supporters while emboldening his greatest enemies. The great strategic mind of the Third Age he no longer possessed."
 excessive_tithe.12.a:0 "Oh well."
 
 excessive_tithe.13.t:0 "Power Struggle!"
 excessive_tithe.13.d:0 "With the human population of Morytania devastated, an uprising of nobles led by [Root.Heir.GetName] has demanded Lowerniel stands down!"

 excessive_tithe.100.dc:0 "Fresh sources of blood have ended the crisis in [Root.GetName]."
 excessive_tithe.100.dd:0 "Somehow, in some unforseen way, the blood crisis is over in [Root.GetName]!"
 excessive_tithe.100.a:0 "Hopefully this won't happen again."
