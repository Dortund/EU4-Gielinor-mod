 institution_events.2.t:0 "Renaissance of Architecture"
 institution_events.2.d:0 "Great building works are not new to Gielinor - the pyramids of Kharid, the city of Prifddinas and so forth are testaments to this - yet construction projects of recent centuries have tended to be impernament or disorganised. However, as the dwarves of Keldagrim, the TzHaar and others increasingly meet with the dwellers of surface lands, their experiences in construction have combined with the practical challenges of the present world to inspire a new architectural tradition. Around Gielinor, new castles and palaces are being commissioned and new, more efficient towns are emerging out of the chaos of the past."
 institution_events.2.da:0 "Great building works are not new to Zeah - the Tower of Magic, the city of Civitas illa Fortis and so forth are testaments to this - yet construction projects of recent centuries have tended to be impernament or disorganised. However, as the dwarves of Lovakengj, the Tasakaal and others increasingly meet with the dwellers of surface lands, their experiences in construction have combined with the practical challenges of the present world to inspire a new architectural tradition. Around Zeah, new castles and palaces are being commissioned and new, more efficient towns are emerging out of the chaos of the past."

 institution_events.201.d:0 "Our greatest thinkers are at something of an impasse in the research of new kinds of building. They have an instinct that somewhere in the world, someone has figured out the solution for the problems they were stuck on. That place, however, is not here."

 institution_events.3.t:0 "Runecrafting"
 institution_events.3.d:0 "Nearly all magic performed by mortals requires runestones, but by the late Fourth Age the remaining supply from the God Wars had all but evaporated. In some remote portions of the world, magic seemed little more than a myth. However, with the discovery of rune essence rocks to the far north of Gielinor, there is once again access to the raw material necessary for creating runes. The runecrafting altars dotted around the world and long-since abandoned are seeing use once more."
 institution_events.3.da:0 "The art of Runecrafting has been limited to a tightly-controlled supply of blood and soul runes from the Dark Altar in northern Kourend. Production was slow and runes were prized possessions among those outside of House Arceuus. However, with the development of new mining processes for dense essence, along with an easing of restrictions concerning who is allowed to manufacture runes, a new age of magic is upon us."
 institution_events.3.db:0 "The Moon Clan split from the Fremennik aeons ago due to our magic. They fear and envy us, and especially find our ability to create new astral runes distasteful - considering it stealing power from the Gods. If we are to win wider support for our skills in magic, we will need to open up our essence mines to outsiders. Let a new age of magic be upon this world!"
 institution_events.3.dc:0 "Long since past, the Hero V discovered a great stone of magic, through which he could create runes. To this time, we have taught that only he was deemed worthy of the art of runecrafting. However, with the discovery of a new mine of rune essence, questions are beginning to be asked about that narrative. Do we tell ourselves this story to excuse our conflict with the Moon Clan, or is it dangerous to meddle with the powers of the Gods? Our society is divided on that matter, but whatever may be, a new age of magic is upon us."

However, with the discovery of rune essence rocks to the far north of Gielinor, there is once again access to the raw material necessary for creating runes. The runecrafting altars dotted around the world and long-since abandoned are seeing use once more."
 institution_events.301.d:0 "Something has changed in the world, but it is unclear what. It is like Gielinor has shifted, just a little. That the future has changed; that the fate of us all is no longer in the Gods' hands but our own."

 institution_events.4.t:0 "Statehood"
 institution_events.4.d:0 "Through runecrafting and growing numbers of mages, emerging human states were able to secure a decisive advantage over their foes and to unite their regions under one flag. The new nations of Asgarnia and Kandarin are key examples. Parallel to this is a movement towards more organised government in realms as diverse as Kourend and Morytania. Though this move towards organised statehood would provide many humans with greater stability than before, it often came at the cost of other races and those of minority religious groups. Conflict between Saradomists and Zamorakians continued - within nations rather than between them."

 institution_events.401.d:0 "Words are being whispered in the realm; of distant shores and distant kings; of new states and new powers; of new opportunities yet new perils. We know not what has happened save that the world has changed."

 institution_events.5.t:0 "Exploration"
 institution_events.5.d:0 "It is difficult to travel in an environment of chaos, but the Fifth Age was a more stable time. More organised states created organised navies capable of protecting trade - and projecting power - around the world. Nations looked for new places to claim and new treasures to take, as well as for potential new alliances in distant, powerful, realms. Despite this shift, much of Gielinor would remain unknown to the typical inhabitants of the world. Only a few adventurers would travel significantly during this time."

 institution_events.501.d:0 "We are lost in a sea of fog; there must be a world out there yet we have not discovered it. Perhaps there are oceans to sail, or deserts to cross. Mountains to climb and river banks to trek. Our people need to know more."

 institution_events.6.t:0 "Quests"
 institution_events.6.d:0 "As travel throughout Gielinor became easier, the number of adventurers grew. No longer a fringe interest but an entire major segment of the workforce, the presence of adventurers revolutionised the world of work. Strange problems that previously required years of training and research could be outsourced to wanderers driven by the desire for experiences more than the need for a constant material compensation. By neatly compartmentalising odd jobs into a category known as Quests, the nations of Gielinor were able to be run more efficiently than ever before."

 institution_events.601.d:0 "Far away, in some unknown town, an adventurer is asked about a cake. Not to bake one, but to gather the ingredients."

 institution_events.7.t:0 "Invention"
 institution_events.7.d:0 "Keldagrim and Dorgesh-Kaan alike pushed Gielinor's technology into incredible new places, though this would just be the start. With the advent of divine energy, actions that previously required machines the size of buildings and vast geothermal power plants now required a device small enough to fit on most pieces of armour. The possibilities of such augmentors are nearly limitless, resulting in a surge in inventors throughout Gielinor. It is rumoured that through the art of Invention may be the only means by which a mortal can take on a God..."

 institution_events.701.d:0 "With the dawning of the Sixth Age, what can we do against the might of the Gods? Our best researchers are struggling with the feeling they are merely very small ants under very large boots. If only there were a means to reassure the people."

 
 
 institution_events.302.t:0 "Travelling Runecrafters"
 institution_events.302.d:0 "For centuries, it was assumed that crafting new runes was impossible for mortals, but new travelling runecrafters inform us they know the secret and are willing to spread it. However, they also inform us that they have enemies - others who view Runecrafting as an affront to the Gods. To accept this help could mark as a future target, though the potential benefits are enormous..."
 institution_events.302.a:0 "Accept the help."
 institution_events.302.b:0 "Reject the help."

 institution_events.303.t:0 "New Wizards"
 institution_events.303.d:0 "With the spread of runecrafting, there has been a huge expansion in the number of people taking up the path of the mage. This has driven quite a culture clash between the small number of established elite wizards, and the newcomers to the art."
 institution_events.303.a:0 "We need the new ideas of the new mages."
 institution_events.303.b:0 "Traditional magic has served us well; we don't need to shake things up."
 institution_events.303.c:0 "Magic is overrated."
 
 institution_events.304.t:0 "Opponents of Runecrafting"
 institution_events.304.d:0 "A group of warriors naming themselves Fremennik claim that the spread of Runecrafting must be stopped as the crafting of runes is heretical."
 institution_events.304.a:0 "We're not going to take the advice of some smelly barbarians!"
 institution_events.304.b:0 "It's for the best that we hold back the spread of runecrafting."
