 string_start_title_cadarn:0 "The Great Divide"
 string_start_cadarn:0 "In the Fourth Age, King Baxtorian Cadarn took his clan east across the Galarpos Mountains to settle a new elven kingdom in Kandarin. Finding friends in the §YGnome Empire§! and among human tribes, the §YCadarn§! kingdom remained secure for centuries.\n\nJust this very year, however, the situation has deteriorated rapidly. With contact with §YTirannwn§! to the west cut off, Baxtorian has led a force to the capital of Prifddinas to attempt to resolve the situation. He has left his wife Queen Glarial behind to rule in his stead. But without the bulk of Cadarn's military forces, the clan shall be left vulnerable to the goblins of the §YThorobshuun§! and §YEkeleshuun§!.\n\nThe upcoming years will be perhaps the hardest Clan Cadarn has ever faced, and a terrible choice may need to be made between risking the Cadarn Kingdom to aid the §YElven Resistance§! in theit fight against Clan §YIorwerth§!, or abandoning them to their fate to save the clan."
  
 string_start_title_carnilleus:0 "The Carnillean Family"
 string_start_carnilleus:0 "By the late Fourth Age, Saradomin's presence in Kandarin was weak, and Zamorak's strong. The allied Mahjarrat §YHazeel§! and §YKhazard§! control much of eastern Kandarin, leaving most of the remainder to Guthixians, Serenists and Armadyleans. Still, with determination and allies, the §YCarnillean§! family may be able to strike into Hazeel's lands and settle the city of §YArdougne§!.\n\nThe first task is to gain strength. The §YGuardians of Ikov§! have similar power to the Carnilleans, but being one of the few Armadylean realms leaves them diplomatically isolated and hence a good potential target. The Guthixian §YSeers' Village§! is similarly isolated. Meanwhile, the §YSinclair§! family and §YCatherby§! may make good allies, vassals or conquest targets - either way is effective. §YCrandor§! could provide a powerful naval support against the Zamorakians.\n\nWith great potential also comes great risk. While the Asgarnian tribes are unlikely to pose a threat due to the chokepoint at White Wolf Mountain, the Fremenniks to the north may well do - especially if they engaged in some kind of anti-magic crusade. Even if the elves of clan §YCadarn§! retreat from Kandarin, a strong §YGnome Empire§! may well fill the void and halt westward expansion."

Controlling Farradorn, former capital of a historic kingdom, gives Donblas a particular legitimacy if they were to seek to unify §YAsgarnia§!. Potentially, the support of the Saradominist White Knights and even the Zamorakian Kinshra may be on offer for a sufficiently ambitious Donblassian ruler.\n\nStill, the future is likely to be full of trials. Zamorakians to the west, most notably the §YDark Wizards§! are a strong rival power likely to be a serious contender. §YMisthalin§! to the east will be kept at bay for the time being due to diplomatic pressures, but this situation will not last forever. Our tribe must prove itself strong enough to assert our independence!"

 string_start_elven_resistance:0 "The Elves of Gielinor consist of eight clans: Amlodd, Cryws, Hefin, Meilyr, Ithell, Trahaearn, - and the two most powerful, §YCadarn§! and §YIorwerth§!. Since Seren brought the clans over to Gielinor in the First Age, they lived peacefully together in §YTirannwn§! with all having a place in the crystalline capital of §YPrifddinas§!.\n\nDuring the devastating God Wars of the Third Age, Tirannwn largely shut itself off from the outside world. At the conclusion of the war, the god Guthix awoke and through his edicts banished all other major gods. Seren could not bear to be apart from her elves and instead shattered herself.\n\nIn the early Fourth Age, King Baxtorian Cadarn took his clan eastward over the Galarpos Mountains to re-establish contact with the world, creating a new elven kingdom. Over time, increasing numbers of elves from other clans poured out of Tirannwn to join his efforts - except those of clan Iorwerth. Now the dominant clan of Tirannwn, Clan Iorwerth's lord has made the unthinkable act of expelling all non-Iorwerth from Prifddinas and declaring themselves the sole legitimate ruler of all elves.\n\nThose who stand against him in Tirannwn form the §YElven Resistance§!, hiding in the woodlands of Isfadar far from Prifddinas. Even with six clans united in this struggle, without the support of Cadarn this struggle shall be extremely difficult - and even with Cadarn's full support, there is no guarantee that Lord Iorwerth's warpath can be stopped and Tirannwn restored..."

 string_start_title_iorwerth:0 "The Fate of Seren"
 string_start_iorwerth:0 "At the end of the God Wars, the god Guthix forced all other major gods to leave Gielinor. Not willing to part from her elves, the goddess Seren instead shattered herself, leaving her followers leaderless. Many elves in the aftermath left their ancient home of §YTirannwn§! to head east, where King Baxtorian §YCadarn§! would create his own new kingdom. Clan §YIorwerth§!, however, has largely stayed behind, gaining power in an increasingly depopulated Tirannwn.\n\nHope for the future of the elves is not lost, however. In the Library of Prifddinas, Lord Iorwerth has discovered an incredible secret - a major fragment of Seren remains somewhere beneath the Galarpos Mountains to the east. Fearful that rival clans may dismiss this discovery as heresy, or even attempt to destroy this remnant, Clan Iorwerth has exiled other clans from Prifddinas and refer to the fragment under the coded name 'Dark Lord'.\n\nIgnorant to the truth of Seren, six elven clans have banded together under the banner of the §YElven Resistance§! to fight against Clan Iorwerth. While initially outmatched by Iorwerth, they may soon be joined by Clan Cadarn or even human allies.\n\nTo save Seren's fragment shall be a terrible trial - one that may take a terrible, yet necessary, cost."

Its capital - recently renamed from Avarrocka to Varrock - is among the greatest in Gielinor, and is well-positioned to become a great centre for trade. Though much of the south is presently occupied by goblins, Misthalin's superior army should minimise any potential threat. \n\nMisthalin's support for the §YKharidians§! to the south-east will likely pay off with a prosperous ally in the future §YAl-Kharid§!.\n\nHowever, this position is not completely secure. While §YMorytania§! to the east is currently suffering from a period of relative weakness, even in its present form it could pose a threat if the temple at Paterdomus were to fall. Settlement of Morytania by Misthalanian humans over a century ago threatens to provide the Vampyres with an easy additional source of blood tithes. Furthermore, incursions from the Wilderness constantly place pressure on the Varrock Palace Guard.\n\nThe region to the west of Misthalin is a wildcard, and could be a threat or an opportunity. A few scattered Misthalanian realms could be easy pickings, but the Asgarnians fear Misthalin's strength and may band together to see this threat off. A unified §YAsgarnia§! could be a power sufficient to destroy Misthalin, or an ally ready to defend Misthalin in all occasions."

Initial diplomacy has gone well, and the Musans will be an excellent first ally in this strange new world. Good diplomacy shall be crucial for the TzHaar going forward as their landlocked status severely limits their potential for expansion.\n\nAlthough Mor Ul Rek is in danger from a potential unified §YAsgarnia§! or §YKandarin§!, its biggest dangers come from within the Karamja Volcano. The TzHaar of the present day live further from the molten core of the volcano than was once the case, and with it the TzHaar have lost a connection to many ancestral memories.

If runecrafting was to come a common act among the peoples of Gielinor once more, it could inspire the more militant anti-magic Fremennik to form a §Ycrusade§! against it.\n\nElsewhere in the Lunar Sea, Fremennik settlers have established the new kingdoms of §YMiscellania§! and §YEtceteria§!, which shall soon be joined by §YJatizso§! and §YNeitiznot§!.
