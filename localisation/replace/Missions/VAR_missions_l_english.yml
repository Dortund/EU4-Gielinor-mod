 VAR_aridas_edge_title:0 "Arida's Edge"
 VAR_aridas_edge_desc:0 "If the citadel at Quaesitum were to fall, the next best hope for a Varlamoran settlement in the region would be to the north-west, at Arida's Edge. While less fertile than Aldarin, on the other side of Tempest Bay, it has a rich diversity in lumber which could be worth exploiting."
 VAR_fletching_guild_title:0 "Fletching Guild"
 VAR_fletching_guild_desc:0 "The rich diversity of lumber at Arida's Edge makes it an ideal place to experiment with woodcarving. Let us establish the Fletching Guild to promote further development of woodcraft!"
 VAR_sight_of_tempestus_title:0 "Sight of Tempestus"
 VAR_sight_of_tempestus_desc:0 "South of Vinolitus we've seen something floating in the skies, but until recently it has been difficult to tell what it is. With the Fletching Guild's development in gliding technologies, we have been able to get a closer view of what appears to be floating islands."
 VAR_settlement_of_tempestus_title:0 "Settlement of Tempestus"
 VAR_settlement_of_tempestus_desc:0 "These floating lands are incredible! Incredibly hard for enemies to reach, constantly sunny and with perfect acoustics. With enough investment, we could build a whole new city here."
 VAR_college_of_bards_mission_title:0 "College of Bards"
 VAR_college_of_bards_mission_desc:0 "The perfect acoustics of Tempestus have begun to attract bards to the region. With some investment, we could really create an ideal place for them."
 VAR_fortis_cothon_title:0 "Fortis Cothon"
 VAR_fortis_cothon_desc:0 "While our cities are well-defended, our key port at Civitas illa Fortis is exposed. By digging out an artificial bay, we can fortify our shipbuilding efforts."
 VAR_imcando_friends_title:0 "Imcando Friends"
 VAR_imcando_friends_desc:0 "Though they still hang onto the god Saradomin, who abandoned us centuries ago, the dwarves of Avizaal are nonetheless trusted friends. We should formalise that relationship."
 VAR_hunters_investment_title:0 "Hunters' Investment"
 VAR_hunters_investment_desc:0 "The Avium Savannah is rich in game but is largely too dangerous to settle. If we are able to establish a Guild of Hunters, they could develop the techniques necessary for us to colonise such a land."
 VAR_tighten_the_troops_title:0 "Tighten the Troops"
 VAR_tighten_the_troops_desc:0 "When our ancestors fled the wrath of Xeric, they knew that it was the raw power of the Lizardmen which gave Xeric's forces strength, not their numbers. As such, we should recognise that quality troops are more important than how many we have."
 VAR_kourendwatch_title:0 "Kourendwatch"
 VAR_kourendwatch_desc:0 "While Varlamore's relations with Great Kourend have generally been strong, we must always remain vigilant. Our relatively unpopulated north coast is vulnerable to coastal landings and should be reinforced."
