 REL_daemonheim_base_camp_title:0 "Daemonheim Base Camp"
 REL_daemonheim_base_camp_desc:0 "A foothold on Daemonheim is insufficient if we are to explore its depths - and our efforts could easily be in vain if threats from the Wilderness intercepted us. We must expand our holdings on Daemonheim."

 REL_longship_culture_title:0 "Longship Culture"
 REL_longship_culture_desc:0 "To be a Fremennik is to sail. Longships are resilient, adaptable, cheap to build and therefore should be used widely in our realm."

 REL_dwarven_diplomacy_desc:0 "Rellekka and Keldagrim share a common interest in Guthix and trade, and where we differ, we can complement the strengths of each other. Keldagrim's technology is useful to us; our naval capabilities are useful to them."

 REL_expand_our_coastline_title:0 "Expand Our Coastline"

 REL_path_of_the_hunter_title:0 "Path of the Hunter"
 REL_path_of_the_hunter_desc:0 "Not all the beasts of the world are as easy to find as those in the Slayer Cave. To Rellekka's north-east, there are many more elusive creatures harder to track. Train our hunters and perhaps we will have the skills and strength to defeat any foe."
