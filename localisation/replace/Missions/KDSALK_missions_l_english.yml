 KDS_religious_tolerance_desc:0 "Nearby Misthalin is a huge Saradomist realm, and our nearest fellow followers of the Menaphite Pantheon are found quite some way into the desert. For the sake of better relations with our closer neighbours, we should take a tolerant approach to their faith."

 KDS_misthalanian_relations_title:0 "Misthalanian Relations"
 KDS_misthalanian_relations_desc:0 "Misthalin benefits greatly from our position guarding the northern Kharidian Desert from bandits and other risks from further south. We should seek a more formal alliance."

 KDS_settle_al_kharid_title:0 "Settle Al Kharid"
 KDS_settle_al_kharid_desc:0 "Below the cliffs we settle is a large expanse of flat and stable land, capable of supporting a major city. With the support of Misthalin, or failing that, Menaphos or even our own determination, we can create the city of Al Kharid."
 KDS_rusum_pass_title:0 "Rusum Pass"

 KDS_hets_land_desc:0 "Het is the most popular of the Menaphire Pantheon in this region. Once a mortal man who held the passes open, he now represents fitness in all its forms.

 KDS_scimitar_manufacture_title:0 "Scimitar Manufacture"
 KDS_scimitar_manufacture_desc:0 "Up to this point, we have tended to rely on small-scale artisan crafting or imports for our weaponry. By developing our own permanent forges, we can more easily supply our armies with the armanents they need."

 KDS_worthy_army_title:0 "Worthy Army"

 ALK_abbey_of_st_elspeth_desc:0 "The growth of Al Kharid has come at the cost of our highlands, but there may be a means of reversing that loss. Saradomist nuns have been searching for a place to call their own, and by offering them part of the highlands, we can begin to repopulate it."
 ALK_the_power_of_runecrafting_title:0 "The Power of Runecrafting"
 ALK_the_power_of_runecrafting_desc:0 "The goblins to our west - a constant threat - are overwhelmingly melee combattants. Mages can deal with them with ease, but with a lack of runes or magically trained people, we lack this perhaps perfect defensive option."

 ALK_local_metal_source_title:0 "Local Metal Source"
 ALK_local_metal_source_desc:0 "As we grow stronger and increasingly independent of the powers which surround us, the supply of strategic resources has become more important than ever. We have located an ore-rich chasm far to the north of Al Kharid, but until this point the high numbers of resident scorpions have made mining operations unfeasible. With sufficient military might, we can take the mine for Al Kharid!"
 ALK_terror_of_tempoross_title:0 "Terror of Tempoross"
