 alltech_7_cannon:0 "Mobile Catapult"
 alltech_7_cannonDESCR:0 "Sieges up to this point have tended to be slow affairs owing to the lack of mobility of siege equipment. However, with the use of a reinforced chassis, we are able to mount a catapult on top of a cart, letting us bring it into any campaign."
 alltech_10_cannon:0 "Mobile Trebuchet"
 alltech_10_cannonDESCR:0 "As siege technology improved, so too did the crews operating these siege weapons. By the end of the Fourth Age, operators of siege equipment were as much feared for their strength in close-quarters as their accuracy at long ranges."
 alltech_13_cannon:0 "Unstable Cannon"
 alltech_13_cannonDESCR:0 "While Dwarven cannon technology remains a closely-guarded secret, many have attempted to reverse-engineer such creations. Early attempts were crude, unstable, and hard to move, yet undoubtedly effective."
 alltech_16_cannon:0 "Mobile Cannon"
 alltech_16_cannonDESCR:0 "Once cannons not made by dwarves became stable enough to last more than a few shots, improving mobility became a key next step."
 alltech_18_cannon:0 "Fireball Launcher"
 alltech_18_cannonDESCR:0 "The spread of runecrafting brought with it a greater appreciation of the magical arts. Within Misthalin, every possibility magic could unlock was being tested, including this unusual magic-based siege weapon. Even beyond human circles, this weapon saw some limited popularity among dwarves as an indirect means of dealing magical damage, something most dwarves are incapable of."
 alltech_20_cannon:0 "Siege Cannon"
 alltech_20_cannonDESCR:0 "The Siege Cannon is among the biggest cannons ever created, though has seen little use on battlefields due to its high upkeep cost."
 alltech_22_cannon:0 "Scrying Cannon"
 alltech_22_cannonDESCR:0 "In response to the advanced targeting systems of Dwarf Multicannons, human mages attempted to solve the same problem from a different approach. Scrying cannons have a small scrying pool built into them showing the precise location the shot will land."
 alltech_25_cannon:0 "Portable Cannon"
 alltech_25_cannonDESCR:0 "Gnomish inventors were able to create a minaturised cannon capable of firing dyed toads at sheep, for unclear reasons. This invention would later be enhanced by the use of powerful air spells to fire cannonballs, becoming an invaluable part of the short, sharp wars that characterised the late Fifth Age and early Sixth Age."
 alltech_29_cannon:0 "Oldak Coil"
 alltech_29_cannonDESCR:0 "The almighty Oldak Coil uses divine energy to convert cannonballs into magical bolts of lightning, capable of dealing immense damage in a limited area."


 bandostech_1_infantry:0 "Bandosian Horde"
 bandostech_1_infantryDESCR:0 "The simple ability to round up a rabble and send it at the enemy has been surprisingly effective for Bandosian commanders in history, largely owing to the unreadiness of many of Bandos' enemies."
 bandostech_5_infantry:0 "Bandosian Club Regiment"
 bandostech_5_infantryDESCR:0 "A club swung with enough force can deal surprising damage, even against armoured foes. Armour is expensive; clubs are cheap."
 bandostech_9_infantry:0 "Refocused Horde"
 bandostech_9_infantryDESCR:0 "A horde can be moderately effective by itself, but lacking sufficient motivation and leadership, it won't be effective for long."
 bandostech_12_infantry:0 "Bandosian Shamans"
 bandostech_12_infantryDESCR:0 "Shamans are the spiritual leaders of Bandosian forces, though they can also be surprisingly powerful combatants as well. Ogre shamans in particular are known to cloud areas in mist that keep away projectile and magical attacks alike."
 bandostech_15_infantry:0 "Goblin Cower Regiment"
 bandostech_15_infantryDESCR:0 "What goblins lack in strength, they make up for in tactical retreat skills. Retreating goblins are a headache for opposing armies to take down, which buys time for the rest of the Bandosian forces."
 bandostech_19_infantry:0 "Reformed Bandosian Horde"
 bandostech_19_infantryDESCR:0 "With the turmoil of the Fourth Age and early Fifth Age settling into something more stable, Bandosians found themselves needing to develop more sophisticated tactics to defeat their now better-defended foes. It is no longer enough just knock walls down - you might have to run a stealth mission to take out the magic gems that protect them first."
 bandostech_23_infantry:0 "Ogress Champions"
 bandostech_23_infantryDESCR:0 "Ogresses are strong, fast and unlike many other powerful Bandosian forces, plentiful in number. It is said the gendered split in ogre society is largely due to the male ogres fearing the women."
 bandostech_26_infantry:0 "Bandos' Chosen"
 bandostech_26_infantryDESCR:0 "The War of the Plain of Mud ended only by the intervention of Bandos himself, who spoke through the goblin prophet Hopespear and told of a future Chosen Commander. Such a Chosen Commander would need an elite force, and committed goblins around Gielinor would soon start competing for the honour."
 bandostech_30_infantry:0 "Unshackled Warriors"
 bandostech_30_infantryDESCR:0 "Though blessed with an effective tactical mind, Bandos' obsession with war above all else gave little time for experimentation or new ideas. New innovations would come from cultures on the periphery of Bandosian worship where rules were less bound - the Ice Trolls of Weiss, the Cyclopes of Cyclosis and the Cloud Giants of Tempestus."

 bandostech_1_cavalry:0 "Kebbit Flank"
 bandostech_1_cavalryDESCR:0 "The kebbits of Oo'glog are highly prone to disease, and they become highly aggressive if they scent burning tansymum. In the late Fourth Age, a common strategy among the Feldip Ogres was to fire arrows tipped with the flaming plant, then release cages of kebbits."
 bandostech_6_cavalry:0 "Larupia Flank"
 bandostech_6_cavalryDESCR:0 "In the jungles between Gu'Tanoth and Oo'glog the lapuria lives. These beasts are wild and untameable, so they are generally caged until they are sufficiently close to enemy forces."
 bandostech_10_cavalry:0 "Spirit Larupia"
 bandostech_10_cavalryDESCR:0 "Taming a wild animal is difficult. Summoning a spirit of an animal, which may live indefinitely and can be desummoned if they become dangerous, is much easier."
 bandostech_14_cavalry:0 "Armoured Jubblies"
 bandostech_14_cavalryDESCR:0 "Jubblies are large, rare and not especially agile birds found in the Feldip Hills. Brief attempts to arm them for war saw limited success, if only because they could be thrown at enemies like a cannonball."
 bandostech_17_cavalry:0 "Platypus Swarm"
 bandostech_17_cavalryDESCR:0 "Platypodes are strange venomous egg-laying mammals native to Oo'glog in the southern Feldip Hills. While generally not a threat, they're known to get aggressive in the presence of burning fever grass. In warfare, an ogre bowman could fasten the grass to an arrow, light the arrow on fire and shoot it into the enemy forces."
 bandostech_23_cavalry:0 "Spirit Scorpion Horde"
 bandostech_23_cavalryDESCR:0 "Summoning multiple creatures at once is a task only suitable for the very best of summoners, though the shamans of Gu'Tanoth have centuries of experience, and even some trolls can pull off such a manoeuvre."
 bandostech_28_cavalry:0 "Dragon Minotaurs"
 bandostech_28_cavalryDESCR:0 "Strong, resilient, and intelligent enough to understand orders but not enough to defy them, spirit minotaurs have frequently served Bandosian summoners well. Summoning such minotaurs requires a metal ingot corresponding to their strength, typically with runite minotaurs being the strongest. However, growing availability of Orikalkum, or Dragon, metal thanks to growing numbers of adventurers has enabled the summoning of stronger minotaurs than ever before."


 centraltech_1_infantry:0 "Tribal Regiment"
 centraltech_1_infantryDESCR:0 "Many of the people of Misthalin and Asgarnia remained highly disorganised into the late Fourth Age, though looming threats of the Wilderness and Morytania helped tie them together."
 centraltech_5_infantry:0 "Central Warriors"
 centraltech_5_infantryDESCR:0 "Following in the tradition of greats like Robert the Strong, Arrav and Camorra, warriors of the central realm fight with determination if not discipline."
 centraltech_9_infantry:0 "Apprentice Battalions"
 centraltech_9_infantryDESCR:0 "The discovery of runecrafting expanded the number of mages in armies throughout the world, most notably in Misthalin and Asgarnia."
 centraltech_12_infantry:0 "Mage Battalions"
 centraltech_12_infantryDESCR:0 "Institutions such as the Wizards' Tower in southern Misthalin helped train a new, more effective generation of mages who found significantly increased use in warfare to an extent not seen since the early Fourth Age."
 centraltech_15_infantry:0 "Crandorian Wizards"
 centraltech_15_infantryDESCR:0 "Crandor Isle's accessible - yet defensible - position made it an ideal trade hub, and an excellent place for mages to hone their craft away from threats like the Runecrafting Crusades."
 centraltech_19_infantry:0 "Misthalin Guard"
 centraltech_19_infantryDESCR:0 "Life among Misthalin Guards is often dangerous, though not typically to the extent of guards in Kandarin and Asgarnia. Reasonably well-trained and reasonably well-equipped, these guards aren't flashy, but are dependable."
 centraltech_23_infantry:0 "Adventurer Clan"
 centraltech_23_infantryDESCR:0 "Misthalin and Asgarnia are the starting points of many adventurers' journeys, and when a single one cannot solve a problem, multiple often can. Adventurer clans may be undisciplined and hard for governments to control, but they are undeniably effective."
 centraltech_26_infantry:0 "Augmented Adventurers"
 centraltech_26_infantryDESCR:0 "New technologies and crafting methods have made adventurers even more potent in battle than ever before."
 centraltech_30_infantry:0 "New World Guardians"
 centraltech_30_infantryDESCR:0 "The God Guthix is known to have assigned extraordinary people the position of World Guardian, though the exact details of this arrangement are unclear. Inspired by the World Guardians of old, some of the most effective adventurers would take on the name for themselves - regardless of Guthix's views."

 centraltech_1_cavalry:0 "Unicorn Cavalry"
 centraltech_1_cavalryDESCR:0 "Unicorns are difficult to tame and ride, though their horn makes an excellent natural weapon to strike foes."
 centraltech_6_cavalry:0 "Cynling Unicornmen"
 centraltech_6_cavalryDESCR:0 "Southern Asgarnia's terrain consists largely of light woodland ideal for unicorns. A great tradition of unicorn riding would emerge in the region during the Fourth Age, though much of this knowledge would be lost following the unification of Asgarnia."
 centraltech_10_cavalry:0 "Spirit Wolves"
 centraltech_10_cavalryDESCR:0 "Taverley's summoners are among the best in Gielinor, though their use of spirit wolves in warfare is often viewed as something of a curiousity. Why would these great summoners call a mere wolf, who practically any budding summoner could summon? The answer lies in their howl, which can make even some of the most powerful beasts run for cover."
 centraltech_14_cavalry:0 "Asgarnian Knights"
 centraltech_14_cavalryDESCR:0 "Asgarnia is home to three key knightly orders: the Saradomist White Knights, the Zamorakian Black Knights and the Guthixian Void Knights. All have good discipline, training, armour and even a decent mixture of combat styles, though their tendency to conflict with one another causes no end of trouble."
 centraltech_23_cavalry:0 "Elite Asgarnian Knights"
 centraltech_23_cavalryDESCR:0 "All of Asgarnia's knightly orders have elite divisions for their most distinguished members, and tend to be issued with superior armour with prayer-enhancing abilities."
 centraltech_28_cavalry:0 "Unified Knights"
 centraltech_28_cavalryDESCR:0 "Since before Asgarnia's unification, there has been a dream of one day bringing together the White, Black and Void Knights for a common cause. Seldom are all three on the same side, but if such a situation occured, they may be unstoppable."
 
 
 dwarventech_1_infantry:0 "Warhammer Regiment"
 dwarventech_1_infantryDESCR:0 "Even the worst dwarven smith can make a capable warhammer, and the blunt force it deals is ideal for striking the tough hide of trolls."
 dwarventech_5_infantry:0 "Battleaxe Regiment"
 dwarventech_5_infantryDESCR:0 "The most popular weapon among dwarves is the battleaxe. Battleaxes are ideal for catching and breaking through enemy shields, and despite lacking the crushing potential of warhammers, can still deliver a lot of force."
 dwarventech_9_infantry:0 "Throwing Axe Regiment"
 dwarventech_9_infantryDESCR:0 "Throwing axes have a power that few ranged weapons possess, though their high expense relative to other forms of ranged ammunition has limited their usage beyond the skilled axe-crafting regions of Keldagrim and Karamja."
 dwarventech_12_infantry:0 "Imcando Mages"
 dwarventech_12_infantryDESCR:0 "The Imcando clan, unlike other dwarves, are able to use magic. With the advent of runecrafting, having some knowledge of the arcane arts became more important than ever and while few Imcando ever served other dwarven realms, those who did were treated as crucial elite troops."
 dwarventech_15_infantry:0 "Superheat Soldiers"
 dwarventech_15_infantryDESCR:0 "Unusually, non-Imcando dwarves were still able to use the Superheat Item spell even when all others became unavailable. Experimental use of Superheat Item as an offensive spell yielded mixed results due to its limited range."
 dwarventech_19_infantry:0 "Black Guard"
 dwarventech_19_infantryDESCR:0 "The iconic Black Guard of Keldagrim defends the city from threats internal and external. Their iconic warhammers can be surprisingly deadly to those who underestimate them."
 dwarventech_23_infantry:0 "Hand Cannoneer"
 dwarventech_23_infantryDESCR:0 "Improvements in cannon manufacture throughout the Fifth Age culminated in a weapon small enough to be held, yet still possessing immense power. Unfortunately, hand cannons are infamously unstable and can be just as devastating to their wielder as to foes."
 dwarventech_26_infantry:0 "Augmented Black Guard"
 dwarventech_26_infantryDESCR:0 "New innovations in Dwarven technology produced the Augmentor, a small device which may be attached to tools, weapon and armour to enhance their capabilities."
 dwarventech_30_infantry:0 "Dwarven Marksmen"
 dwarventech_30_infantryDESCR:0 "The Hand Cannon holds promise as a weapon. By sacrificing a bit of firepower for portability and reliability, a weapon can be created as devastating to mages as the Barbarian Gunnar once was."
 
 dwarventech_1_cavalry:0 "Mountain Goats"
 dwarventech_1_cavalryDESCR:0 "Dwarves typically fought in close-quarters in the late Fourth Age, and had little need for cavalry. Occasionally mountain goats were tamed to ward off intruders to Keldagrim, but there is little record of them being used in active warfare."
 dwarventech_6_cavalry:0 "Goat Cavalry"
 dwarventech_6_cavalryDESCR:0 "While use of goats in warfare is rare, a small number of dwarves were successful in using them as a form of slow, yet nimble, cavalry."
 dwarventech_10_cavalry:0 "Minecart Chariot"
 dwarventech_10_cavalryDESCR:0 "In close quarters, a speeding minecart is hard to dodge. With a top speed exceeding most unicorns and a more sturdy body, the minecart is only let down by its need to follow an existing track."
 dwarventech_14_cavalry:0 "Cannon Goats"
 dwarventech_14_cavalryDESCR:0 "The hardier goats of Trollweiss can carry more weight than the average dwarf and their sturdiness means they are relatively resilient to cannon recoil."
 dwarventech_17_cavalry:0 "Cannon Carts"
 dwarventech_17_cavalryDESCR:0 "Improvements in metallurgy enabled ever-more advanced cannons to be mounted on top of minecarts without the cannon derailing the cart apart every time it fired."
 dwarventech_23_cavalry:0 "Hand Cannoneer Cavalry"
 dwarventech_23_cavalryDESCR:0 "Hand Cannoneers mounted on minecarts or goats tended to have smaller devices than those on foot, but the mobility advantages made this a worthwhile tradeoff."
 dwarventech_28_cavalry:0 "Trackless Minecarts"
 dwarventech_28_cavalryDESCR:0 "The trackless minecart has been an elusive dream for centuries. Even earlier attempts such as a steam-powered wheelchair were limited by their inability to cross rough terrain. However, with the re-discovery of rubber in the Feldip Hills, and growing knowledge of alternative energy sources in Dorgesh-Kaan and elsewhere, the Trackless Minecart may finally be a reality."

 dwarventech_7_cannon:0 "Explosive Crossbow"
 dwarventech_7_cannonDESCR:0 "Explosive Crossbows are relatively crude weapons - being as devastating to their operators as they are to enemy walls - but are undeniably effective against foes which have never seen explosives before."
 dwarventech_10_cannon:0 "Dwarf Cannon"
 dwarventech_10_cannonDESCR:0 "Dwarves have been known to use cannons since the Third Age, though as most fled underground to avoid the God Wars much of the expertise of cannon-building was lost. Now, with dwarves resurfacing, the need to bring out the old blueprints has returned."
 dwarventech_13_cannon:0 "Mithril Cannon"
 dwarventech_13_cannonDESCR:0 "A typical Dwarven cannon is manufactured with steel due to its moderate strength and affordability. However, mithril cannons had two key advantages - one, their lower weight made them easier to transport, and two, their greater strength allowed cannonballs to be shot at greater force without damaging the barrels."
 dwarventech_16_cannon:0 "Dwarven Mortar"
 dwarventech_16_cannonDESCR:0 "Dwarven cannons tend to fire straight ahead, as the low ceilings of many caves block the use of higher angles. However, this gave the dwarves a distinct disadvantage in open terrain - most exemplified in the fall of Camdozaal where the lack of range of the Imcando cannons allowed Barbarian armies to easily close the gap. As a consequence, the dwarves of Keldagrim began to design an alternative cannon for open areas with a more easily-adjustable firing angle."
 dwarventech_18_cannon:0 "Adamantite Cannon"
 dwarventech_18_cannonDESCR:0 "Perhaps the heaviest cannon to see widespread use, adamantite cannons were capable of even mightier shots than mithril cannons. The time of adamantite cannons was short-lived, however, due to their poor mobility and the high cost of construction."
 dwarventech_20_cannon:0 "Dwarf Multicannon"
 dwarventech_20_cannonDESCR:0 "There are actually two models of cannon known as the Dwarf Multicannon. The first consisted of multiple cannons firing in eight directions at once, which was swiftly discontinued due to its habit at firing indiscriminately at friend and foe alike. The second Multicannon, perhaps named to erase the memory of the first, is Gielinor's most iconic siege weapon. The new multicannon automatically turns and locates targets to fire upon, and is portable enough to be carried by a single person."
 dwarventech_22_cannon:0 "Golden Cannon"
 dwarventech_22_cannonDESCR:0 "After the Dwarf Multicannon saw considerable success among adventurers, dwarves in Falador attempted to capitalise upon its success by offering subtle upgrades. One of these upgrades - the Golden Cannon - is capable of holding a greater number of cannonballs."
 dwarventech_25_cannon:0 "Royale Cannon"
 dwarventech_25_cannonDESCR:0 "While widely ridiculed in Keldagrim for its immense amount of ornamentation, the Royale Cannon nonetheless sold incredibly well to human adventurers, due in part to its ability to self-reload."
 dwarventech_29_cannon:0 "Kinetic Cyclone"
 dwarventech_29_cannonDESCR:0 "Capable of tearing buildings to rubble in seconds, the Kinetic Cyclone makes up for in damage and durability what it lacks in range."


 elventech_1_infantry:0 "Elven Skirmishers"
 elventech_1_infantryDESCR:0 "The long lives of the elves encourages the minimalising of casualties. Consequentially, guerilla tactics are often employed by Elven realms even when they have a numbers advantage."
 elventech_5_infantry:0 "Elven Spearmen"
 elventech_5_infantryDESCR:0 "A skilled crystal singer is capable of making weaponry even stronger than that made of runite, though throughout Elven history the results have varied immensely. Crystal spears are among the easier crystal weapons to sing to a reliable strength, and were commonplace in the Elven armies of the late Fourth Age."
 elventech_9_infantry:0 "Isfadar Raider"
 elventech_9_infantryDESCR:0 "The forest of Isfadar was a key site of battles in the Tirannwn Civil War. Its lack of open space incentivised use of small raiding forces as opposed to more conventional armies."
 elventech_12_infantry:0 "Crystal Rangers"
 elventech_12_infantryDESCR:0 "Crystal Bows need no ammunition, only occasional maintenance with crystal singing. They are excellent for prolonged expeditions in dangerous regions where forces need to limit the amount of ammunition they carry."
 elventech_15_infantry:0 "Isfadar Ambushers"
 elventech_15_infantryDESCR:0 "The Tirannwn Civil War elevated skirmish tactics to ever more effective heights. By the end of the war, every tree in Isfadar was viewed with suspicion as an enemy soldier could be hiding anywhere."
 elventech_19_infantry:0 "Amlodd Mage"
 elventech_19_infantryDESCR:0 "Along with Clan Cadarn, Clan Amlodd has traditionally been home to the greatest elven mages. Using ancient spells and skills honed over centuries, their prowess is not to be underestimated."
 elventech_23_infantry:0 "Prifddinas Guard"
 elventech_23_infantryDESCR:0 "Prifddinas is among Gielinor's oldest - and wealthiest - cities. The city's guards protect the lives and wealth of the city's citizens with a discipline far outstripping guards found in most human realms."
 elventech_26_infantry:0 "Crystalline Shapeshifters"
 elventech_26_infantryDESCR:0 "Parted from Seren, Clan Cywir - the lost clan of the elves - survived by grafting crystal onto themselves. These crystals gave these elves the power to shapeshift. A small number of these Crystalline Shapeshifters were seen in combat during the Third Age, where they could kill an Ourg in a single hit."
 elventech_30_infantry:0 "Unified Clan Tactics"
 elventech_30_infantryDESCR:0 "The nine elven clans have often operated separately to serve a greater whole, though this can create weaknesses during battles where co-ordination can be poor. A new, common sense of purpose has driven the elves to a greater level of collaboration than ever before - with the potential to devastate all those who stand against them."
 
 elventech_1_cavalry:0 "Dire Wolves"
 elventech_1_cavalryDESCR:0 "Dire wolves saw great use in Seren's forces during the God Wars, though in this more peaceful time many have become feral. Still, disciplined or not, dire wolves are deadly opponents."
 elventech_6_cavalry:0 "Wolf Cavalry"
 elventech_6_cavalryDESCR:0 "A few dire wolves were retained under the control of the Elves, resulting in a well-trained and at times brutally effective - if small - cavalry force."
 elventech_10_cavalry:0 "Skirmish Cavalry"
 elventech_10_cavalryDESCR:0 "The Elven Civil War mostly involved combat in the rough terrain of Isfadar, Arandar and the Underground Pass. Cavalry, therefore, had to emphasise mobility over speed."
 elventech_14_cavalry:0 "Amlodd Cavalry"
 elventech_14_cavalryDESCR:0 "Clan Amlodd's summoners can bring forth a range of creatures and spirits suitable for any occasion."
 elventech_17_cavalry:0 "Reformed Dire Wolf Cavalry"
 elventech_17_cavalryDESCR:0 "Summoners understand animals in ways that others do not. Discoveries from Amlodd's summoners regarding wolf behaviour enabled elven cavalry to handle their dire wolves more effectively than ever before."
 elventech_23_cavalry:0 "Crystal Knights"
 elventech_23_cavalryDESCR:0 "Elf-crystal is incredibly strong and not especially heavy, making it suitable for armour for wolves, unicorns and other mounts - albeit at a very high cost."
 elventech_28_cavalry:0 "Hunllef Cavalry"
 elventech_28_cavalryDESCR:0 "A terrifying creature from the elven homeworld of Tarddiad, the Hunllef is as devastating as it is untameable. Or is it?"


 fremenniktech_1_infantry:0 "Barbarian Clubmen"
 fremenniktech_1_infantryDESCR:0 "Many a more organised army falls at the hands of the Barbarian Clubmen, and a key reason is their tendency to be underestimated. A club may be a crude weapon, but it can break bones as easily as a warhammer."
 fremenniktech_5_infantry:0 "Barbarian Axemen"
 fremenniktech_5_infantryDESCR:0 "Battleaxes are most commonly found among dwarven forces, though the Fremennik too have made use of them at times. Barbarian axes are typically two-handed and quite unwieldy. A strong warrior can deal immense damage with them, but an unskilled soldier is more likely to cause themselves an injury - if not from the blade, from its sheer weight."
 fremenniktech_9_infantry:0 "Barbarian Spear Throwers"
 fremenniktech_9_infantryDESCR:0 "Traditionally, Barbarian women were most often trained in the art of spear-throwing, though in time these boundaries would be broken down. Known for their ability to capture cities as well as their ability to accurately hit their targets, spear-throwers have been a key part of Barbarian armies since at least the Third Age."
 fremenniktech_12_infantry:0 "Barbarian Berserkers"
 fremenniktech_12_infantryDESCR:0 "Berserkers sacrifice personal defence in favour of devastating melee damage. Their tendency to work themselves into rages made them as much a threat to their own armies as their enemies', however."
 fremenniktech_15_infantry:0 "Fremennik Seers"
 fremenniktech_15_infantryDESCR:0 "Seers have had a strange role in Fremennik culture. Their use of mystic arts draws many to claim they're simply mages by another name, rebranding to avoid the negative association with magic in much of the Fremennik Lands. Still, their distinct use of foresight to plan future battles is a skill somewhat rare in Gielinor."
 fremenniktech_19_infantry:0 "Honour Guard"
 fremenniktech_19_infantryDESCR:0 "Most commonly seen on the island of Neitiznot, Honour Guard protect their leaders and their nations fiercely even with minimal armour and supplies."
 fremenniktech_23_infantry:0 "Rellekkan Warriors"
 fremenniktech_23_infantryDESCR:0 "Fremennik Warriors are renowned for their excellent morale and ability to keep fighting no matter what strange beasts are set upon them. Many an invader of Rellekka has been surprised with just how resilient their forces are despite their seemingly outmoded equipment."
 fremenniktech_26_infantry:0 "Banite Warriors"
 fremenniktech_26_infantryDESCR:0 "Banite is a strong metal found in shades from dark purple to dark blue, and even yellow. While discovered on Jatizso earlier in the Fifth Age, the strange dread-inducing feelings unattuned Banite would induce in its wielders limited its use until methods were discovered to attune it."
 fremenniktech_30_infantry:0 "Allbane Warriors"
 fremenniktech_30_infantryDESCR:0 "As strong as banite metal can be when attuned against a specific target, once attuned it cannot be reattuned - limiting its effectiveness when used against a range of enemies. However, incorporation of divine augmentation and integrated superheat spells allows for banite to be reforged and hence reattuned as it fights, ensuring a consistently strong level of power."

 fremenniktech_1_cavalry:0 "Fremennik Wolves"
 fremenniktech_1_cavalryDESCR:0 "The Fremennik have a complicated relationship with wolves owing to their prophesied role in the End of All Things, though on the other hand, many Fremennik and wolves served Guthix together in the late Third Age. Wolves can make an effective flanking force to complement the close-range tactics favoured by most Fremennik."
 fremenniktech_10_cavalry:0 "Barbarian Wolf Cavalry"
 fremenniktech_10_cavalryDESCR:0 "The most careful of Barbarians managed to tame wolves sufficiently to ride them into battle. And what a devastating force a wolf's speed and Fremennik fury makes! Limited numbers of tamed wolves restricted the potential of such a combination, but where it could be used it was to great effect."
 fremenniktech_14_cavalry:0 "Barbarian Raider Cavalry"
 fremenniktech_14_cavalryDESCR:0 "Runecrafting Crusaders believed that time was against them before the spread of runecrafting became unstoppable. To that end, large numbers of wolves and unicorns were pressed into service by the Gunnite crusaders."
 fremenniktech_23_cavalry:0 "Rellekkan Riders"
 fremenniktech_23_cavalryDESCR:0 "Since the end of the Runecrafting Crusades, cavalry declined in popularity among the Fremennik in favour of unmounted warriors. Nonetheless, the remaining cavalry have been noted for their ability to navigate woods and embark or disembark from ships with ease."
 fremenniktech_28_cavalry:0 "Valkyrie"
 fremenniktech_28_cavalryDESCR:0 "Defenders of Valhalla and protectors of the Fremennik at the End of All Things, the Valkyrie shall descend to Gielinor when the need is at its greatest..."
 
 
 gnometech_1_infantry:0 "Gnomish Infantry"
 gnometech_1_infantryDESCR:0 "The footsoldiers of the Gnomish Empire had what most of their foes lacked - discipline. Gnomish soldiers are famed for staying on the battlefield even in the face of certain defeat."
 gnometech_9_infantry:0 "Reformed Gnomish Infantry"
 gnometech_9_infantryDESCR:0 "While the Battle of Atarisundri was a complete success for the Gnome Empire, this was entirely down to the illusion magics of Glouphrie the Untrusted - not to the Gnomish infantry. Serious questions were asked in the battle's aftermath regarding the readiness of the military for future conflicts, leading to a series of reforms. Unfortunately, these largely came too late to prevent the splitting of the Gnome Empire in two."
 gnometech_12_infantry:0 "Gnome Mages"
 gnometech_12_infantryDESCR:0 "Betrayal of the Gnome Empire by some mages caused something of a distrustful attitude towards the art by many Gnomes, though with the rise of Runecrafting at the start of the Fifth Age it became apparent Gnomes must field enough mages of their own to compete with humans."
 gnometech_15_infantry:0 "Gnome Guards"
 gnometech_15_infantryDESCR:0 "The fall of the Gnome Empire led Gnomish realms to become more insular for a time. Such a movement - coupled with the general distrust towards mages at the time - largely spared gnomes from Gunnar's Runecrafting Crusades."
 gnometech_19_infantry:0 "Grand Tree Peacekeepers"
 gnometech_19_infantryDESCR:0 "As the Gnome Stronghold turned inwards, it grew paranoid. Although it did not shut itself off from outside visitors, it did suspect them - leading to an ever-growing so-called peacekeeping operation until corruption within the highest levels of government was exposed."
 gnometech_23_infantry:0 "Gnomeball Veterans"
 gnometech_23_infantryDESCR:0 "The often-brutal contact sport of Gnomeball requires speed, agility, power and good aiming to perform well - and it's no wonder that many Gnomeball players end up recruited into Gnomish militaries."
 gnometech_26_infantry:0 "Arposandran Mages"

 gnometech_10_cavalryDESCR:0 "Admiral Bake, one of the finest Gnomish explorers, discovered giant tortoises strong of shell and easy to tame. They lack the speed of terrorbirds but their immense defence allows them to excel in many areas terrorbirds can't."
 gnometech_14_cavalry:0 "Reformed Terrorbird Cavalry"
 gnometech_14_cavalryDESCR:0 "Careful breeding of Terrorbirds allowed for cavalry with much greater stamina than unicorns, and use of mounted mage cavalry gave them significantly more power than before."

 gnometech_23_cavalryDESCR:0 "Gnomecopters are a kind of one-gnome flying machine with immense manoeuvrability and decent power. There is some evidence of devices similar to modern Gnomecopters being used in the Third Age, but the modern incarnation's invention is largely credited to Hieronymus Avlafrim and Sasquine Huburns by merging the technologies of magic carpets, gnome gliders and blueprints left by Yewnock the Engineer."
 gnometech_28_cavalry:0 "Glidercopters"
 gnometech_28_cavalryDESCR:0 "Gnomecopters may have great manoeuvrability and power, but they are expensive to build and flimsy in defence limiting their cost-effectiveness in war. The Glidercopter combines the manoeuvrability for Gnomecopters with the ability to soar like Gliders for a more efficient flight, allowing a larger, more sturdy body and the ability to carry multiple passengers."

 kandarintech_9_infantry:0 "Kandarin Apprentices"
 kandarintech_9_infantryDESCR:0 "By the very end of the Fourth Age, the human-led realms of Kandarin began to reform into more organised kingdoms, and their militaries alongside it.

 kandarintech_6_cavalryDESCR:0 "Bulldogs are relatively small, but their strength and loyalty makes them a useful asset in time of war.

 wushankotech_1_cavalryDESCR:0 "Do not underestimate the effectiveness of crabs in combat. Their shells are tough, their claws devastating, and salt crabs in particular can be devastating to open wounds."
 wushankotech_6_cavalry:0 "Sirenic Whaleriders"
 wushankotech_6_cavalryDESCR:0 "One of Wushanko's most common forms of cavalry are the Sirenic Whaleriders. Their close bond to their animals inspired a new age of cavalry tactics in Wushanko, even for those riding other, more terrestial animals."
 wushankotech_10_cavalry:0 "Chimeras"
 wushankotech_10_cavalryDESCR:0 "A firebreathing creature from The Hook resembling a combination of various animals, chimeras are used to great effect in more open parts of the Wushanko Isles."
 wushankotech_14_cavalry:0 "Ferocious Tiger-Riders"
 wushankotech_14_cavalryDESCR:0 "Tigers are powerful, quick, agile - and usually solitary, making them tough to train. Still, for those who succeed, those who tame and ride tigers terrify all who they oppose."
 wushankotech_17_cavalry:0 "Reef Riders"
 wushankotech_17_cavalryDESCR:0 "Travelling quickly through and over water with the help of animals, magic or even machines, Reef Riders take the strategies pioneered by Sirenic Whaleriders with considerably more agility."
 wushankotech_23_cavalry:0 "Anagami"
 wushankotech_23_cavalryDESCR:0 "Ascended Acolytes of Seiryu eventually take the form of spirit serpents. Their extensive combat training coupled with their slender, agile form make them near-impossible for most opponents to even land a blow, while they have the ability to retaliate with lightning."
 wushankotech_28_cavalry:0 "Shi Cavalry"
 wushankotech_28_cavalryDESCR:0 "Shi are the guardian lions of Kami-shima, formed into existence if the island is sufficiently under threat. Few know of their existence; even fewer know of their abilities and potential."
 
 
 zeantech_1_infantry:0 "Zean Warriors"
 zeantech_1_infantryDESCR:0 "The original human and dwarven settlers of Zeah came to flee a war, and their descendents were little-prepared when war started from within. Since the time of Xeric, all realms of Zeah are sure to keep a well-trained force ready in case of such devastation repeating itself."
 zeantech_5_infantry:0 "Zean Strikers"
 zeantech_5_infantryDESCR:0 "The continent of Zeah's relatively low population density has encouraged the use of more mobile infantry tactics."
 zeantech_9_infantry:0 "Zean Regiment"
 zeantech_9_infantryDESCR:0 "Kourend's civil war would drive significant changes in how its militaries were comprised. For one, houses aside from Shayzien necessarily had to develop their own armed forces. For another, forces had to be retrained to be able to fight fellow humans and dwarves after years of predominantly fighting lizardmen."
 zeantech_12_infantry:0 "Arceuus Mages"
 zeantech_12_infantryDESCR:0 "Magic has dominated Arceuus for a generation - a very long generation. Combat magic, however, has declined in use over the centuries and only in the wake of growing internal conflict in Kourend have many citizens of Arceuus begun practicing combat magic once more."
 zeantech_15_infantry:0 "Kualti"
 zeantech_15_infantryDESCR:0 "Elite guard of Varlamore's royalty, the Kualti are famed for their experience, discipline and recordkeeping. Kualti ceremonial daggers are unique to each individual member, making it extremely difficult for any individual member of the guard to betray Varlamore."
 zeantech_19_infantry:0 "Shayzien Soldiers"
 zeantech_19_infantryDESCR:0 "Founded in the Fourth Age by Camorra Shayzien, the city of Shayzien has since been the home for Kourend's military and police force. Shayzien soldiers are raised from a young age in the crafts of war, and such skills combined with their relatively large numbers makes them a dangerous force to cross."
 zeantech_26_infantry:0 "Tempestite Mages"
 zeantech_26_infantryDESCR:0 "The floating city of Tempestus is best-known for its College of Bards, and while music can be a magic all of its own, it is not the only power at play here. Tapping into the ancient powers that cause the city to float, Tempestite Mages develop a unique take on the craft which few understand."
 zeantech_30_infantry:0 "Twisted Rangers"
 zeantech_30_infantryDESCR:0 "Deep beneath Mount Quidamortem is the Great Olm, whose remains were carved into the infamous Twisted Bows. While extremely powerful against mages, the incredible rarity of the bows limited their practical application - until a curious event happened. The power of the Great Olm seemed to seep into the plantlife of the Kebos Lowlands, generating additional bows - but at what cost?"

 zeantech_1_cavalry:0 "Zean Unicorns"
 zeantech_1_cavalryDESCR:0 "Zeah's unicorns were initially used not as mounts but as draft animals, and consequentially tend to be somewhat stockier and slower than those found on Gielinor's central continent."
 zeantech_10_cavalry:0 "Centralis Riders"
 zeantech_10_cavalryDESCR:0 "Open savannas of central Varlamore demand specialist cavalry capable of suriving in remote arid regions. Natural selection of introduced unicorns have, over the centuries, resulted in a resilient breed of unicorn unique to Varlamore which has been particularly effective in operations far from Varlamore's core territory."
 zeantech_14_cavalry:0 "Shayzien Knights"
 zeantech_14_cavalryDESCR:0 "Shayzien's rough terrain typically makes it impractical for extensive use of cavalry. However, the hardier unicorns of Zeah could find limited use as mounts in the region."
 zeantech_23_cavalry:0 "Wader Cavalry"
 zeantech_23_cavalryDESCR:0 "Kebos Swamp is a land too treacherous for most non-lizardmen, impairing the efforts of Great Kourend in their ambitions to drive them away once and for all. Once trade routes with the mainland reopened, however, creatures such as giant frogs could be imported to act as a mobile cavalry force for such regions."
 zeantech_28_cavalry:0 "Wyrm Cavalry"
 zeantech_28_cavalryDESCR:0 "Serpentine, unpredictable wyrms are found beneath Mount Karuulm and the Avium Savannah. Fighting in both melee and magical combat, they just require an experienced rider with archery skills to become incredibly tough to counter."
